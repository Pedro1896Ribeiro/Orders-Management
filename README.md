# Orders-Management

This project is part of a broader solution that implements a marketplace used by producers, resellers
and other related companies, to put their products on sale.
This project focuses on an mobile application for these companies to receive and fulfil orders placed
by marketplace customers. 

This project aims to develop an application in React Native supported by a REST service (part of this
project), based on the following assumptions:
  The application is supported by a back-office service that complements the functions requested
for this application - a service that will have to be simulated (for example, by filling in the data
directly in the database).
